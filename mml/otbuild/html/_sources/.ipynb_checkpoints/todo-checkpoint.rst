TODO: Remember to check why the OT matrix X^* is not symmetric

TODO: In tex, slightly adapt the notation of Cuturi Alg1 so that gradient is not confused with G (the Wasserstein distance)

TODO: IF the pseudometric matrix has off-diagonal zeros then add some small constant to the whole metric. 

Two ways I make this work, I either change the POT implementation to be faster, which is highly unlikely or I train it on smaller datasets, hence less OT to calculate.

TODO: Optimize the algorithms to return exactly what's needed.
